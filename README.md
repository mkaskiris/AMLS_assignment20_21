# AMLS_assignment20_21
1. Put dataset in dataset folder
2. For task A dataset folder should  be called 'celeba'
3. For task B dataset folder should be called 'cartoon_set'
4. Each folder should contain another folder named 'img' containing the images and a 'labels.csv' containing the labels
5. the labels.csv file should be of the same form as with the ones released with the assignment

Note: need to put shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat in folder a2 for the facial landmarks extraction to work. File is too big for github
